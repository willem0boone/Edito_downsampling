## Objective
Some datasets have very high resolution which makes them too "heavy" for certain applications. These notebooks illustrate how you can create a downscaled product, e.g. resample a high resolution (~m) 20GB Zarr file to a medium resolution (~km) product. 

## EDITO
These notebooks are available as tutorials in the [EDITO Datalab](https://datalab.dive.edito.eu/). This demonstration makes use of the [resampling package](https://github.com/willem0boone/Edito_resampling_datasets).
